# SDN2GO
A Deep Learning Model for Protein Function Prediction.

SDNGO is a deep learning model for predicting protein functions using protein sequences, protein domains, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks.

This repository contains script which were used to build and train the SDN2GO model.

# Scripts
Validation.py - This script is used to build and train the model and evaluate the performance of the model.

Weight_nodom_model.py - This script is used to build and train the model without domain features.

my_Utils.py - This script contains some utility functions.

# Data

The ‘data’ folder contains the data files that the script depends on
